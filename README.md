# ttihp25a-tt10-vga: A Tiny Tapeout Verilog project based on Matt Venn's VGA Clock

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

NOTE: This is implemented using the TT10 Verilog Template originally designed for sky130, but if it gets fabbed it will most likely be by the IHP fab. I've verified it fits and works by using the `@ttihp25a` branch of the TT GitHub Actions.
